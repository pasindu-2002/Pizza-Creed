## Introduction

Pizza Creed is a Spring Boot application providing RESTful APIs for managing pizza orders. It includes functionalities such as listing available pizzas, creating shopping baskets, managing basket items, and checking out orders.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) - [Download and Install JDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)

- MySQL Database - [Download and Install MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)

### Database Configuration

1. Create a MySQL database for the application with the name `pizzacreed`.
2. Navigate to `src/main/resources` and locate the `application.properties.template` file.
3. Duplicate the `application.properties.template` file and remove the `.template` extension, creating a new file named `application.properties`.
4. Open the `application.properties` file in a text editor.
5. Update the file with your database details, including the username and password.

### Running the Application

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
   (On Windows, use `mvnw` instead of `./mvnw`)
   
3. The application should now be running at `http://localhost:8181`.
